<div class="custdiv">A donation is a gift, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy medical needs also. Donations of goods or services are also called gifts in kind.
It is possible to donate in the name of a third party, making a gift in honor or in memory of someone or something. Helping, giving, volunteering, and other actions undertaken to benefit others play a critical role in protecting health, promoting education, fighting poverty and hunger, and providing disaster relief.
And yet there are selfless acts happening all the time; there are countless examples of people who have given everything – in some cases their own lives – to help, or to try and help, those in need. Why do they do this?</div>
